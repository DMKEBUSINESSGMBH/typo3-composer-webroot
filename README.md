# DMK TYPO3 Composer Webroot Project

Creates a filebased [TYPO3](http://typo3.org/) installation
with [Composers](https://getcomposer.org/).


## Usage

### Project Creation

Create a new TYPO3 Project using Composer

    $ composer create-project dmk/typo3-composer-webroot my-project-webroot dev-typo3-87

This creates the required Folders for TYPO3,
for example the fileadmin, typo3conf, etc.

The installation process should look like this:

    Installing dmk/typo3-composer-webroot (dev-typo3-87)
    - Installing dmk/typo3-composer-webroot (dev-typo3-87 typo3-87)


    Created project in my-project-webroot
    Loading composer repositories with package information
    Installing dependencies (including require-dev)
      - Installing typo3/cms-composer-installers (dev-master)

      - Installing typo3/cms (7.6.10)

      - Installing typo3-ter/be-secure-pw (7.0.6)

    Writing lock file
    Generating autoload files
    Generating class alias map files

Then you'll be asked if you want to remove the GIT history.
This we should do!

    Do you want to remove the existing VCS (.git, .svn..) history? [Y,n]? Y

Now we should initialize a new repo

    $ git init

do the initial commit

    $ git add --all
    $ git commit -m "initial commit"

add the new project remote

    $ git remote add origin [PATH_TO_PROJECT_REPOSITORY]

and push the project to the repo

    $ git push --set-upstream origin master

### Specific DocRoot

In a lot of cases it will be usefull to define a DocRoot for the projekt.
So the public files will be stored there and all other, like vendor, are outside.

This feature is new in the CmsComposerInstaller since 1.2.2. and enabled by default.

### Add Extensions

To install an extension from the [TER](https://typo3.org/extensions/repository/),
for example static_info_tables, you can simply perform the following command:

    composer require typo3-ter/static-info-tables:~7.6@stable

Pay attention to replace underscores "_" by a dash "-" in the extension key.


To append an extension from a own repository,
you has to add the repository to the composer.json first.
To add the powerful MKSEACRH extension you has to perform the following command:

    $ composer config repositories.mksearch vcs https://github.com/DMKEBUSINESSGMBH/typo3-mksearch.git

Be sure, that there is an composer.json in the repository like this one:

    {
        "name" : "dmk/mksearch",
        "type" : "typo3-cms-extension",
        "keywords" : ["TYPO3 CMS", "search", "Lucene", "Zend Lucene", "Apache Solr", "Solr", "Elasticsearch"],
        "homepage" : "http://www.dmk-ebusiness.de/",
        "license" : "GPL-2.0+",
        "replace": {
            "typo3-ter/mksearch": "*"
        }
    }

Now you can install the Extension with the require command:

    composer require dmk/mksearch:dev-master

Finally install the extension with the TYPO3 Extension Manager in the TYPO3 Backend
add the composer.json, composer.lock, typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php, typo3conf/PackageStates.php
to the git and commit and push the changes.

### Customization

  * Replace the `warning_email_addr` `example@example.com` in the `BE` Section in the LocalConfiguration.php.
  * Replace `fromEmail` `noreply@domain.de` in the extension configuration for rn_base.
  * Replace `XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX` in the `.htaccess*` files with the IP that can access the System in maintenance mode.
  * Replace `###PUT_HOMEPAGE_HERE###` in the `.htaccess*` files with the domain of the environment. 
  * Use .htaccess_* as .htaccess file for your environments.
  * Create `htdocs/typo3conf/Credentials.php` with all the security critical data like database credentials.  
    A example is given in typo3conf/Credentials.php.inst
  * Create an encryption key and insert the key in the Credentials.php (don't store security critical data in git).
  * Optionaly enable some improvements in the extension configuration of MK TOOLS.
    we recommend to enable the following features:
      * pageNotFoundHandling
        Adjust pageNotFound_handling in LocalConfiguration.php. See [MK TOOLS Documentation](https://github.com/DMKEBUSINESSGMBH/typo3-mktools/blob/master/Documentation/Utilities/PageNotFoundHandling/Index.md)
      * seoRobotsMetaTagActive
